      <p>
        Property Hero is a responsive web app that empowers first time buyers to
        find their perfect home. In designing the user interface my aim was to
        allow users to easily find properties that match their criteria and
        identify properties' features at a glance. Further, users can compare
        homes, add listings to their favorites, and contact sellers.
      </p>
      <p>
        This is a project I designed in the context of the CareerFoundry UI
        Specialization course.

      <div class="case-study-grid__text">
        <h3>User Flow</h3>
        <p>
          Before jumping into wireframing I created a user flow to plan out how
          a user would move through the application. My users would need a way
          of signing up for the app, receiving personalized property
          recommendations, and an effective way to search and filter the
          listings in their area.
        </p>
        <p>
          Once a user finds a property they are interested in, they need to be
          able to easily access it’s key information, as well as contact the
          seller and compare it to similar listings.

    <div class="case-study-grid">
      <div class="case-study-grid__text">
        <h3>Visual Hierarchy and UI Patterns</h3>
        <p>
          To create a predictable and intuitive user interface I consulted
          common UI patterns and mapped them onto wireframes. I used visual
          hierarchy, including sizing and spacing to help optically guide the
          user through their task.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="case-study-grid__image">

        />
      </div>
      <div class="case-study-grid__text">
        <h3>Moodboards</h3>
        <p>
          Next I created two moodboards that each spoke to a different side of
          our target demographic of first-time buyers.
        </p>
        <p>
          While the blue moodboard would appear familiar to young city-dwellers,
          I felt the green moodboard would appeal to those seeking to buy
          property outside of urban centers or in the countryside.
        </p>
        <p>
          Ultimately I chose to proceed with my design using the blue moodboard,
          as I felt its familiar feel and modern sans-serif fonts would have
          broader appeal for prospective investors and would suit a wider range
          of properties.

        <h3>Typography</h3>
        <p>
          When choosing the typography for Property Hero I decided to pair the
          sans-serif fonts Raleway and Nunito for a modern, minimalist feel that
          wouldn't distract from the product's main functionality.

      <div class="case-study-grid__text">
        <h3>Color</h3>
        <p>
          For a crisp, neutral experience that would feel appropriate to urban
          and rural users alike, I created a monochromatic color palette based
          on warm blues.

      <h3>Style Guide</h3>
      <p>
        I collected all UI elements, including colors, patterns, and icons in a
        style guide. This document includes measurements in addition to guidance
        as to how individual elements should be used in the development and
        design of the product.

        <h3>Design Iterations</h3>
        <p>
          Here you can see the iterative progression of my design from low to
          high fidelity wireframes. I began by blocking out the major UI
          components and focusing on the overall user journey through the app.
          As my design became more refined I attended to the visual details of
          color, typography, and iconography.
