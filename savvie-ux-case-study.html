          Savvie is a responsive web app that aims to ease the transition to
          adulthood by connecting young adults with education, career, and
          personal finance advisers. The app also provides text and video based
          resources, as well as a forum where young adults can exchange
          experiences and get advice from their peers. Savvie is aimed at
          students, young professionals, and expats between the ages of 18 and
          30.
        </p>
        <p>
          This is a project I designed in the context of the CareerFoundry UX
          Immersion course.

          <h3>The Problem…</h3>
          <p>
            challenges facing young adults, including moving away from home,
            entering higher education, starting a career, and managing finances
            can often feel overwhelming.
          </p>

          <p>
            Unfortunately, it can be difficult to find a comprehensive online
            resource that addresses all of these areas of concern. While many
            young adults rely on family and friends for help, these trusted
            advisers may find it difficult to provide guidance if the young
            adult in their lives moves abroad or enters a career field that is
            foreign to them.
          </p>
          <p>
            That’s where Savvie comes in. Savvie is a responsive web app that
            aims to provide support to young adults across the globe on topics
            ranging from moving away from home to personal finance. Users can
            contact advisers directly for one-on-one call sessions or browse
            text and video-based resources.
          </p>
          <p>
            I began this project by conducting a
            <strong>competitive analysis</strong> of similar apps that match
            users with tutors or specialize in teaching users new skills through
            video instruction. This analysis allowed me to identify the
            strengths and weaknesses of my competition. It also illuminated what
            is missing in the online landscape of resources for young adults.
          </p>
          <p>
            The competitive analysis helped clarify my ideas for my responsive
            web app. Based on my findings I drafted a
            <strong>problem statement</strong> that would guide my design
            concept.
          </p>
          <p>
            Before diving into further research and interviewing potential
            users, I established the app’s key requirements as executable
            <strong>user stories</strong>.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="case-study-grid__image emphasis-shadow">
          <h3>User Stories</h3>
          <p>
            As a user, I want to be able to gain relevant insights into the
            topic at hand before contacting an expert, so I can receive useful
            information almost instantaneously without first scheduling a call.
          </p>
          <p>
            As a user, I want the app to suggest experts to me whose expertise
            matches my profile, so that I don’t have to spend time scrolling
            through endless pages and comparing multiple experts with one
            another.
          </p>
          <p>
            As a user, I want to be able to browse experts and get the most
            important information about them at a glance, so that I can quickly
            assess whether or not I want to know more about them.
          </p>

        </div>
        <div class="case-study-grid__text">
          <h3>User Interviews</h3>
          <p>
            Next, I conducted both an <strong>online survey</strong> as well as
            three in-depth <strong>interviews</strong> with young adults in
            their twenties.
          </p>
          <p>
            I wanted to find out what struggles they associated with young
            adulthood and in which areas of their life they felt they needed
            support. Furthermore, I wanted to discover how to best address their
            needs in my app design.
          </p>
          <p>
            Then I consolidated and analyzed my data using
            <strong>affinity mapping</strong>. This helped me uncover:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Which topics my app should cover.</li>
            <li>
              Which modes of interaction with advisers would be most salient.
            </li>
            <li>
              Which additional features would be most important to my
              prospective users.
            </li>
            <li>
              The context in which prospective users would utilize the app.
            </li>
            <li>
              Potential concerns and deal-breakers that would stop potential
              users from exploring the app.
            </li>
            <li>Which payment plans prospective users preferred.</li>
          </ul>
        </div>
      </div>

      <div class="case-study-grid">
        <div class="case-study-grid__text">
          <h3>User Personas</h3>
          <p>
            Now I used my consolidated data to create three personas who each
            represented my distinct target audience groups: Students, recent
            university graduates, and young professionals.
          </p>
          <p>
            Each persona has unique motivations, behaviors, and needs that I
            would need to account for in my app design.
          </p>
          <p>
            Referencing these personas throughout the project have proved an
            effective way to empathize with prospective users and keep their
            needs in mind.

        </div>
        <div class="case-study-grid__text">
          <h3>User Journey Maps</h3>
          <p>
            In order to visualize the stages through which users progress as
            they pursue a particular goal I created user journey maps for each
            of my personas.
          </p>
          <p>
            By considering how the persona would respond mentally and
            emotionally to each task they encountered along the way, I was able
            to identify which features were imperative to include for a seamless
            user experience.
          </p>
          <p>
            After mapping the user journey for my persona Stuart, a recent
            university graduate who wants to find an adviser with whom he can
            discuss career planning, I identified the following opportunities:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Stuart needs to be able to see the adviser’s qualifications at a
              glance.
            </li>
            <li>
              Stuart needs to be able to share pertinent information about
              himself with the adviser.
            </li>
            <li>
              We can give Stuart personalized recommendations, so that he will
              find a qualified adviser faster.
            </li>
            <li>
              Stuart needs effective filtering options to find the adviser best
              suited to his needs.
            </li>

          <h3>User Flows</h3>
          <p>
            Next I turned the user stories from my user journey maps into user
            flows in order to discover which screens would be necessary for a
            user to complete a given task. These user flows helped lay the
            foundation for planning the app’s information architecture.

          <h3>Sitemap</h3>
          <p>
            After planning the initial information architecture I conducted an
            open card sort to help me refine the sitemap. Seven participants
            grouped 26 cards into categories that made sense to them.
          </p>
          <p>
            The card sort helped me identify recurring grouping patterns. I used
            these results to make a few changes to my sitemap that would yield a
            more intuitive and logical user experience.

            After reviewing usability heuristics, common design patterns, and
            deciding which navigation patterns would best suit the different
            features of my app, I began translating my user flows into paper
            wireframes for mobile and desktop.
          </p>
          <p>
            These initial sketches allowed me to focus on the basic navigation,
            interaction, and placement of elements on the individual screens.
          </p>
          <p>
            On the right you can see the mobile screens that allow a user to

          <p>
            Having already established the design patterns and rough placement
            of elements, I fine-tuned the sizing and spacing of elements in the
            high-fidelity wireframes and inserted real copy to give a better
            idea of what the look and feel of the final product would be.
          </p>
          <p>
            Finally, I linked the wireframes into an interactive prototype using
            InVision.

          <h3>Usability Testing</h3>
          <p>
            Now I was ready to conduct usability tests with six participants.
          </p>
          <p>
            I asked my participants to complete four scenario-based tasks in
            order to assess their ability to execute basic tasks, such as
            creating an account, scheduling a call with an adviser, and reading
            an article.
          </p>
          <p>
            I collected all my findings, both positive and negative, in a
            rainbow spreadsheet (left).
          </p>
          <p>
            The tests helped me identify five main issues that I addressed in
            the next design iteration:
          </p>
          <ol>
            <li>Participants had trouble navigating the hamburger menu.</li>
            <li>
              Participants were uncertain about how to navigate subcategories in
              the career resources section.
            </li>
            <li>
              Participants wanted to enter more information about themselves for
              a more tailored experience.
            </li>
            <li>No average rating was displayed for the advisers.</li>
            <li>
              After scheduling a call some participants were unsure if the call
              was confirmed or not.
            </li>
          </ol>

        <div class="case-study-grid__text">
          <h3>Revisions</h3>
          <p>
            After reviewing my findings from the usability tests, I made several
            revisions to the prototype.
          </p>
          <p>
            On the right you can see two of the changes I implemented after
            receiving participants’ feedback. This is the screen the user sees
            after scheduling a call with the adviser Ben Adams.
          </p>
          <p>
            Understandably
            <strong
              >some users were confused whether or not the call had been
              scheduled successfully, because there was no indication</strong
            >
            of it on the adviser’s profile. Therefore, to indicate that the user
            has scheduled a call, I changed the “schedule call” button to read
            “call booked” instead.
          </p>
          <p>
            Another user pointed out that although she could read reviews about
            the adviser,
            <strong>she could not see their average rating</strong>. Therefore,
            I created a new icon to show the adviser’s average rating and
            positioned it near the top of the adviser’s profile.
          </p>
        </div>
      </div>
      <h2 class="accent-color--savvie">04 User Interface Design</h2>
      <div class="case-study-grid">
        <div class="case-study-grid__text">
          <h3>Visual Design</h3>
          <p>
            Now I was ready to bring color to the user interface. I decided to
            build my color palette around a warm yellow to create a welcoming,
            friendly atmosphere for users.
          </p>
          <p>
            Because the app addresses topics that might make some users nervous,
            I implemented several strategies to put them at ease, including
            using a friendly, conversational tone throughout the app, using
            <strong
              >warm, non-obtrusive colors, and using illustrations instead of
              photos</strong
            >
            where possible.
          </p>
          <p>
            For a clean, modern feel I chose to use the complementary sans-serif
            fonts Futura and Montserrat throughout the design.
          </p>
          <p>
            In order to ensure a consistent layout I also made use of 12-column
            grids.

            I revised the design further after collecting
            <strong>peer feedback</strong> and reviewing
            <strong>WCAG guidelines</strong>. The changes I made included
            fine-tuning the spacing of elements, improving system feedback, as
            well as improving the color-contrast ratio of text elements.

        <h3>Design Language System</h3>
        <p>
          After polishing the UI design, I created a design language system
          document, in which I detailed how color, typography, UI elements, and
          language should be used throughout the app to achieve a cohesive
          product.
